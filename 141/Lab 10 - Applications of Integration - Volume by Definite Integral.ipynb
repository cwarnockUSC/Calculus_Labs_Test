    "The topic of Volume of Revolution is often difficult for students to grasp. With different methods, formulations, and rotating axes, this topic may appear confusing at first and adequate practice is a must.

    "Now that we can see the solid, we can decide whether we should use the disk/washer method to find the volume, or the shell method. For this example, it is easier to use the disk/washer method since we can find the volume with a single integral. Since there is some open space in our solid, we need to use the washer method. Recall that the formula for calculating the volume using the washer method is $$V = \\pi\\int_a^b (R(x)^2 - r(x)^2) \\ dx,$$ where $R(x)$ is the top function and $r(x)$ is the bottom function. In this example, we have that $R(x) = 2 - x^2$ and $r(x) = x.$ We can use Sage to calculate this volume using the $\\textbf{integrate}(\\dots)$ command from Lab 9."

    "Now, we need to decide whether we should use the disk/washer method or the shell method. By looking at the solid, we can see that using rectangles which run parallel to the axis of revolution will result in only having to use a single integral to calculate the volume. Therefore, we will use the shell method. Recall that the formula for calculating the volume using the shell method is $$V = 2\\pi\\int_a^b r(x)h(x) \\ dx,$$ where $r(x)$ is the distance that our generic rectangle is from the axis of revolution and $h(x)$ is the height of our generic rectangle. Since the axis of revolution is the $y$-axis, we have that $r(x) = x$.
