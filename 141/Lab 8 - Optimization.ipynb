    "### General Steps for Solving Optimization Problems\n",
    "The following strategy for solving optimization problems is outlined on Page 264 of the text.\n",
    "1. Read and understand the problem. What is the unknown? What are the given quantities and conditions?\n",
    "2. Draw a picture. In most problems it is useful to draw a picture and identify the given and required quantities in the picture.\n",
    "3. Introduce variables. Asign a symbol for the quantity, let us call it $Q$, that is to be maximized or minimized. Also, selct symbols for other unknown quantities. Use suggestive notation whenever possible: $A$ for area, $h$ for height, $r$ for radius, etc.\n",
    "4. Write an equation. Express $Q$ in terms of some of the other unknown variables. If $Q$ has been expressed as a function of more than one variable, use the given information to find relationships (in the form of equations) among these variables. Then use the equations to eliminate all but one of the variables in the expression for $Q$.\n",
    "5. Test the critical points and endpoints in the domain of the variable. Use the methods of Section 4.1 to find the $\\textit{absolute}$ maximum or minimum value."
