    "The definite integral of $f(x)$ is defined as the limit of Riemann sums $$\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x) \\ dx = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*) \\Delta x.$$ To use the above definition to compute or estimate $\\int_a^b f(x) \\ dx,$ we first choose $n$ (the number of subintervals) and set $\\Delta x = (b-a)/n$ (the length of each subinterval). Next, we need to choose $x_k^*$ in each subinterval. Some popular choices are the left endpoint, the right endpoint, or the midpoint of each subinterval. We then increase $n$ to get better and better approximations. Of course, this leads to messy computations as there are $n$ terms in the sum and a closed form is in general very hard to find. \n",
    "\n",
    "A completely different way to compute definite integrals is to use the FTC, $$\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x) \\ dx = F(b) - F(a), \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{ where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$.}$$ The FTC relates definite integrals (which are numbers as signed areas) to indefinite integrals (which are functions as antiderivatives). This is great if you know how to find $F(x)$. The problem is that sometimes it can be very difficult (or even impossible) to find a closed form  of $F(x) = \\int f(x) \\ dx.$ Sage is very capable of finding indefinite integrals but don't be surprised if it fails."

The code below will calculate the Riemann sum of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ using $n$ subintervals and using either left endpoints, midpoints, or right endpoints. It will also graph $f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ and graph the rectangles used to calculate the Riemann sum.\n",
