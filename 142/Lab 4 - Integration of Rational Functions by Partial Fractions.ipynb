    "We will use Sage to verify our partial fraction decomposition and our integration of the rational function $f(x) = \\dfrac{2}{(x+1)(x-1)}.$ The general form of the partial fraction decomposition of $f(x)$ is $$\\dfrac{2}{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\dfrac{A}{x+1} + \\dfrac{B}{x-1}.$$ In order to solve for $A$ and $B$ by hand, we would clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by the denominator original denominator. This results in the equation $$2 = A(x-1) + B(x+1) = (A + B)x + (-A + B).$$ Therefore, in order to solve for $A$ and $B$, we must solve the system of linear equations $$\\left \\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} A + B & = & 0 \\\\ -A + B & = & 2 \\end{array} \\right .$$ In the previous lab, we used the $\\textbf{solve}$ command to solve a single equation.

The first thing we need to do is factor the denominator of $f(x)$. Let $denom(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 2$ be the denominator of $f(x)$. Recall that $(x-a)$ is a factor of $denom(x)$ if and only if $denom(a) = 0$. Therefore, in order to factor the cubic $denom(x)$, we look for numbers $a$ such that $denom(a) = 0$. Note that $denom(a) = 0$ if and only if $x=a$ is an $x$-intercept of $d(x)$. Therefore, we use Sage to plot $d(x)$ and determine any $x$-intercepts."

It follows that $f(x) = \\dfrac{6x^2 - 7x}{(x-2)(x^2+1)}$. Now that we have factored the denominator of $f(x)$, we can use partial fraction decomposition to write $f(x)$ as the sum of simpler fractions. Recall that the general form of $f(x)$ into partial fractions is $$\\dfrac{6x^2 - 7x}{(x-2)(x^2+1)} = \\dfrac{A}{x-2} + \\dfrac{Bx + C}{x^2 + 1}.$$ Multiplying both sides of the equation by $(x-2)(x^2 + 1)$ gives the equation $$ 6x^2 - 7x = A(x^2 + 1) + (Bx + C)(x-2) = (A+B)x^2 + (C - 2B)x + (A - 2C).$$ Equating coefficients, we obtain the system $$\\left \\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} A + \\ \\ B \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ & = & 6 \\\\ - \\ 2B \\  + \\ \\  C & = & -7 \\\\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ - 2C & = & 0 \\end{array} \\right .$$ We again use Sage to solve this system."
